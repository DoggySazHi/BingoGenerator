# BingoGenerator
A webpage that will generate "Bingo" boards based on given input.
This is currently based upon the Ptable&reg; Disord server's responses.
## What is this?
...Yes. It generates grids based on strings.
A Node.js file is included if you want to run this locally, however it is [also hosted on GitHub as well.](https://doggysazhi.github.io/BingoGenerator/)

## Contribution
Just send a pull request. I'll most likely merge it as long as it isn't anything profane.

## License
Honestly, I don't care whoever uses this, since it's just a personal project. However, if you really care, only the code for the website is under the [MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) license.
The strings for random messages is free domain.
